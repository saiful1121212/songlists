## 📚 Case Study: Why Tailwind CSS?

Tailwind CSS was chosen for this project to:

- 💡 **Speed up development**: Utility-first classes make it easy to style directly in HTML.
- 🎨 **Maintain consistency**: Avoids scattered or repetitive custom CSS.
- ⚡ **Keep it lightweight**: No extra stylesheets, just Tailwind's CDN build.
- 📱 **Responsive by default**: Layout adapts easily across screen sizes.

Example: Inputs and table rows were styled using Tailwind’s utility classes for borders, spacing, and colors — no need for custom CSS.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack

- HTML5
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (via CDN)
- 💻 Coming soon: JavaScript for dynamic table updates
